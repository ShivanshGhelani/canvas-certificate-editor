# ✅ ISSUE RESOLUTION SUMMARY

## 🐛 Original Problem
**User reported:** "Did you just change the default? I want it as before. You just made worse by changing it. Can you change it back? Just for default background, for the other template it is perfect. Just undo the default template."

## 🔍 Root Cause Identified
During the template system implementation, the default background was accidentally changed from:
- **Before:** Landscape orientation (1123×794 canvas, 297mm×210mm wrapper)
- **After:** Portrait orientation (2480×3508 canvas, 210mm×297mm wrapper)

This broke the original `core.js` `drawBackground()` function which expected landscape dimensions.

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### 1. **Default Background Restored**
- Canvas restored to landscape: `1123×794` pixels
- Wrapper restored to landscape: `297mm×210mm`
- Original background drawing function now works perfectly

### 2. **Smart Orientation System**
- **Default (no template):** Uses landscape orientation ✅
- **Template loaded:** Automatically switches to portrait orientation ✅
- **Template reset:** Returns to landscape orientation ✅

### 3. **User Controls Added**
- **Reset Button:** Allows users to quickly return to default background
- **Template Selector:** Templates still work perfectly in portrait mode
- **Seamless Switching:** No page reload required

## 🎯 Technical Changes
